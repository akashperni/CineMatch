- **Scalable Engine**: Efficient handling of large movie datasets for fast and accurate recommendations.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **app.py**: The main application file containing the Streamlit app.
- **movie_recommendation.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook used for data preprocessing and model building.
- **similarity.pkl**: Precomputed similarity matrix used for making recommendations.
- **movie_list.pkl**: Pickle file containing the list of movies and their metadata.
- **tmdb_5000_credits.csv**: Dataset containing the movie credits information.
- **tmdb_5000_movies.csv**: Dataset containing the movie details.

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cinematch.git
    cd cinematch
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Extract relevant features from the datasets such as genres, cast, and crew.
   - Vectorize the features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.

2. **Similarity Calculation**:
   - Calculate the similarity between movies using cosine similarity or another suitable metric.
   - Store the similarity matrix for quick lookup during recommendations.

3. **Recommendation Engine**:
   - When a user selects a movie, CineMatch retrieves the most similar movies from the similarity matrix.
   - The recommendations are displayed in a visually appealing format with movie titles and posters.


## 🧠 Future Improvements

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Integrate user-based collaborative filtering for more accurate recommendations.
- **Advanced NLP Techniques**: Utilize BERT or other advanced NLP models for better feature extraction.
- **User Profiles**: Allow users to create profiles to save preferences and receive tailored recommendations over time.
